            <h2>Why Start or Buy a Business?</h2>
            <p>Starting or buying a business is a major decision, but it can open the door 
                to more freedom, flexibility, and long-term financial growth. When 
                you own a business, you’re in control you set the direction, make 
                the key decisions, and directly benefit from the success of your 
                efforts. Whether you choose to build something from the ground up or 
                take over an existing business, the opportunity to grow something of
                your own is both challenging and rewarding. Unlike a regular job, 
                owning a business gives you the chance to work on your own terms and
                build real value over time. Some types of businesses are more 
                profitable or stable than others, especially for first-time owners. 
                That’s why it’s important to know what to look for whether it’s low
                startup costs, steady demand, or room for growth. Understanding 
                these factors can help you choose the right path and avoid costly
                mistakes.</p>
